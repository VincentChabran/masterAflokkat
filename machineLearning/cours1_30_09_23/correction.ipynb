Formaliser le problème\n","\n","Lorsqu'on est confronté à un problème, il est souvent bénéfique d'y réfléchir à tête reposée et de l'analyser plutôt que de se lancer tête baissée dans le code. C'est particulièrement vrai en machine learning, puisqu'il est essentiel de _formaliser_ un problème pour qu'une machine puisse apprendre à le résoudre. Voici donc quelques questions à se poser systématiquement :\n","\n","1. Le machine learning est-il réellement approprié pour mon problème ?\n","2. Quelles données vais-je pouvoir utiliser ?\n","3. Comment vais-je mesurer la performance de mon modèle ?\n","\n","Pour ce TP, notre problème sera de différencier entre mines et rochers à partir de mesures prises par un sonar. Essayons de répondre aux trois questions ci-dessus :"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"710755f5-2ef1-45fc-a3e7-00b99cd85810","metadata":{"id":"710755f5-2ef1-45fc-a3e7-00b99cd85810"},"source":["1.
