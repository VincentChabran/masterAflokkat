oracle-21c-vagrant
This Vagrant project builds an Oracle Linux 8 virtual machine.

The virtual machine is provisioned with scripts from the scripts directory, configuration files from the config directory and other installation files that need to be placed in the same directory as this README.md.

The scripts install the following software:

Oracle Database 21.0.3
MySQL 8.0.26 (or higher)
Apache Hadoop 3.3.4
Apache Spark 3.3.2
Oracle NoSQL Database Enterprise Edition (KVStore) 22.3.32 with examples 22.1.16
Apache Hive 3.1.3
MongoDB 3.4
JDK 8
Python 3.9
R 4.2.2 (or higher)
Editors: nano and vim
Build the Virtual Machine
This section explains how to build this virtual machine on your computer.

Prerequisites
Hardware
To build and run this project it is required that your computer supports virtualization, have 30G of available disk space and 5G of available RAM.

Software
Install a Git client (for example git SCM).
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1 (Vagrant doesn't support VirtualBox version 7 at the time of writing).
Install the VirtualBox Extension Pack.
Install Vagrant and (optionally) the vagrant-env plugin.
Setup installation files
Clone this repository's staging branch.
git clone -b staging https://github.com/SergioSim/vagrant-projects.git
Download the Oracle Database 21.3.0 installation zip file (LINUX.X64_213000_db_home.zip) from OTN (the first time only) and place it in the vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0 directory: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html
Download the Oracle NoSQL Database Enterprise Edition 22.3.32 installation zip file (V1034077-01.zip) and examples (V1020129-01.zip) from OTN (the first time only) and place it in the vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0 directory: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/nosql-database-server-downloads.html
Note: Do not unzip the installation files. Double check that the installation filenames match : LINUX.X64_213000_db_home.zip, V1034077-01.zip and V1020129-01.zip.

Build and start the virtual machine
Open a terminal and change into the vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0 directory.
$ cd vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0
Run the vagrant up command in your terminal.
$ vagrant up
The first time you run this it will provision everything and may take a while. Ensure you have a good internet connection as the scripts will update the Virtual Machine via yum.
The installation can be customized, if desired (see Configuration).
It might be useful to keep the installation traces (they can provide debugging information if something goes wrong or other useful information that might be needed afterwards, for example, the auto-generated Oracle Database passwords)
Interact with the virtual machine using vagrant
Here we describe some common commands to interact with the virtual machine using vagrant.

To start interacting with the virtual machine, open a terminal and change into the vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0 directory.

$ cd vagrant-projects/OracleDatabase/21.3.0
Get virtual machine status information
To get a short report about the current state of the virtual machine, you can use the following command:

$ vagrant status
The command should output something like:

Current machine states:

oracle-21c-vagrant        running (virtualbox)
Stop the virtual machine
To stop the virtual machine you can use the following command:

$ vagrant halt
Remove the virtual machine
To remove the virtual machine completely you can use the following commands:

$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant box remove oraclelinux/8
Start the virtual machine
To start or restart the virtual machine you can use the following command:

$ vagrant up
Note: Provisioning scripts only run once at the very first start.

Connect to the virtual machine via SSH
To open a SSH connection with the virtual machine you can use the following command:

$ vagrant ssh
The command should provide you with a bash prompt for the vagrant user inside the virtual machine (without requiring a password):

[vagrant@oracle-21c-vagrant ~]$
Note: the vagrant user has sudo privileges. If you would like to switch to the root user you can run the sudo su - command.

Common usage examples
Once you have connected to the virtual machine via ssh you can try out to run some of the common usage examples described in EXAMPLES.md

Troubleshooting
If some components of this virtual machine stop working it is possible to re-install them by re-running their corresponding provisioning scripts.

To reinstall prerequisites (JDK 8/vim/nano) and setup .bashrc and .bash_profile:
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/02_prerequisites.sh
To reinstall Hadoop:
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/03_install_hadoop.sh
To reinstall Spark
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/04_install_spark.sh
To reinstall KVStore
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/05_install_kvstore.sh
To reinstall Hive
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/06_install_hive.sh
To reinstall MongoDB
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/07_install_mongodb.sh
To reinstall R
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/08_install_R.sh
Optional provisioners
Some optional/utility provisioning scripts are available.

To update all changes made in the config directory (recopy all files to their corresponding destination).

vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/update_config.sh
To downgrade MongoDB version to 3.4

Warning: This command removes all previous data stored on MongoDB.

vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/99_downgrade_mongodb.sh
To enable MongoDB authentication

Note: It uses the VM_MONGO_ADMIN_USERNAME and VM_MONGO_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables to create the MongoDB administrative user.

vagrant provision --provision-with 99_enable_mongodb_authentication.sh
To disable MongoDB authentication

Note: It doesn't remove the MongoDB administrative user.

vagrant provision --provision-with 99_disable_mongodb_authentication.sh
To install Kafka

Note: Kafka consumes 1.5 G of additional RAM, consider increasing the VM_MEMORY up to 6-7G in the Vagrantfile or stop unused services to save memory.

Note: running the 02_prerequisites.sh script is only required if you have installed the VM prior to the Kafka installation addition.

vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/02_prerequisites.sh
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/99_install_kafka.sh
To install Sqoop

Note: running the 02_prerequisites.sh script is only required if you have installed the VM prior to the Sqoop installation addition.

vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/02_prerequisites.sh
vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/99_install_sqoop.sh
Note: Sqoop doesn't work well with Yarn in "local" mode. It is required to change Yarn's deployment mode to "pseudo-distributed" by editing /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml and setting the value of the property: mapreduce.framework.name to yarn:

<property>
    <name>mapreduce.framework.name</name>
    <value>yarn</value>
    <description>
      Local mode runs faster in a single node setup for simple tasks.
      To use pseudo-distributed mode set the value to "yarn".
    </description>
</property>
For the changes to apply - restart Yarn:

stop-yarn.sh
start-yarn.sh
To install Jupyter Notebook

vagrant provision --provision-with scripts/99_install_jupyter.sh
To start Jupyter Notebook (inside the VM):

cd /vagrant
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0
Connecting to Oracle
The default database connection parameters are:

Hostname: localhost
Port: 1521
SID: ORCLCDB
PDB: ORCLPDB1
EM Express port: 5500
Database passwords are auto-generated and printed on install
These parameters can be customized, if desired (see Configuration).

Resetting password
You can reset the password of the Oracle database accounts (SYS, SYSTEM and PDBADMIN only) by switching to the oracle user (sudo su - oracle), then executing /home/oracle/setPassword.sh <Your new password>.

Running scripts after setup
You can have the installer run scripts after setup by putting them in the userscripts directory below the directory where you have this file checked out. Any shell (.sh) or SQL (.sql) scripts you put in the userscripts directory will be executed by the installer after the database is set up and started. Only shell and SQL scripts will be executed; all other files will be ignored. These scripts are completely optional.

Shell scripts will be executed as root. SQL scripts will be executed as SYS. SQL scripts will run against the CDB, not the PDB, unless you include an ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = <pdbname> statement in the script.

To run scripts in a specific order, prefix the file names with a number, e.g., 01_shellscript.sh, 02_tablespaces.sql, 03_shellscript2.sh, etc.

Configuration
The Vagrantfile can be used as-is, without any additional configuration. However, there are several parameters you can set to tailor the installation to your needs.

How to configure
There are three ways to set parameters:

Update the Vagrantfile. This is straightforward; the downside is that you will lose changes when you update this repository.
Use environment variables. It might be difficult to remember the parameters used when the VM was instantiated.
Use the .env/.env.local files (requires vagrant-env plugin). You can configure your installation by editing the .env file, but .env will be overwritten on updates, so it's better to make a copy of .env called .env.local, then make changes in .env.local. The .env.local file won't be overwritten when you update this repository and it won't mark your Git tree as changed (you won't accidentally commit your local configuration!).
Parameters are considered in the following order (first one wins):

Environment variables
.env.local (if it exists and the vagrant-env plugin is installed)
.env (if the vagrant-env plugin is installed)
Vagrantfile definitions
VM parameters
VM_NAME (default: oracle-21c-vagrant): VM name.
VM_MEMORY (default: 5120): memory for the VM (in MB, 5120 MB = 5 GB).
VM_SYSTEM_TIMEZONE (default: host time zone (if possible)): VM time zone.
The system time zone is used by the database for SYSDATE/SYSTIMESTAMP.
The guest time zone will be set to the host time zone when the host time zone is a full hour offset from GMT.
When the host time zone isn't a full hour offset from GMT (e.g., in India and parts of Australia), the guest time zone will be set to UTC.
You can specify a different time zone using a time zone name (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles") or an offset from GMT (e.g., "Etc/GMT-2"). For more information on specifying time zones, see List of tz database time zones.
Oracle Database parameters
VM_ORACLE_BASE (default: /opt/oracle/): Oracle base directory.
VM_ORACLE_HOME (default: /opt/oracle/product/21c/dbhome_1): Oracle home directory.
VM_ORACLE_SID (default: ORCLCDB): Oracle SID.
VM_ORACLE_PDB (default: ORCLPDB1): PDB name.
VM_ORACLE_CHARACTERSET (default: AL32UTF8): database character set.
VM_ORACLE_EDITION (default: EE): Oracle Database edition. Either EE for Enterprise Edition or SE2 for Standard Edition 2.
VM_LISTENER_PORT (default: 1521): Listener port.
VM_EM_EXPRESS_PORT (default: 5500): EM Express port.
VM_ORACLE_PWD (default: automatically generated): Oracle Database password for the SYS, SYSTEM and PDBADMIN accounts.
Optional plugins
When installed, this Vagrant project will make use of the following third party Vagrant plugins:

vagrant-env: loads environment variables from .env files;
vagrant-proxyconf: set proxies in the guest VM if you need to access the Internet through a proxy. See the plugin documentation for configuration.
To install Vagrant plugins run:

vagrant plugin install <name>...
Other info
If you need to, you can connect to the virtual machine via vagrant ssh.
You can sudo su - oracle to switch to the oracle user.
On the guest OS, the directory /vagrant is a shared folder and maps to wherever you have this file checked out
